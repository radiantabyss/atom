## Threshold UI theme

A dark UI theme, based on One Dark UI, enchanced for a more native feel on Windows.

> I'm using [Convergent Syntax](https://github.com/binaryfunt/convergent-syntax) and [Minimap](https://atom.io/packages/minimap) in the screenshot. Also, I've ticked "Auto Hide Menu Bar" in settings.

### Installation

1. Go to File > Settings
1. Click "+ Install"
1. Search for threshold and click the "Themes" button
1. On "Threshold UI", click the "Install" button


<!-- ### Settings

In the theme settings you can switch between 3 __Layout Modes__:

1. `Auto` (default) - In Auto mode, the UI and font size will automatically change based on the window size.
2. `Compact` - The UI stays compact to leave more space for the editor.
3. `Spacious` - The UI is expanded, giving some breathing room.

As well as change the __Font Size__ to scale the whole UI up or down. -->
